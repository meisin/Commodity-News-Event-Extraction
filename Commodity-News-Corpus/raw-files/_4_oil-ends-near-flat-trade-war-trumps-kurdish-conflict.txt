Investing.com – Trade uncertainties and geopolitical tensions continue to push and pull the oil market, limiting whichever direction it goes. Crude prices settled near flat Monday as continued worries about the U.S.-China trade war offset initial highs reached by the market on a U.S. decision to stop protecting Kurdish rebels in Syria.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 6 cents, or 0.9%, at $52.75 per barrel, after earlier reaching $54.05, its highest since Thursday.

U.K. Brent oil settled down 2 cents at $58.35.
