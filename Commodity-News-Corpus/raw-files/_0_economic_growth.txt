China is expected this week to report economic growth slowing to 7.2 percent from a year ago, the weakest since the depths of the last global economic crisis.

Brent crude oil prices fell below $49 a barrel and U.S. crude also fell more than $1 on Monday after the global economic outlook weaken and Iraq announced record oil production.

Global oil demand is softening at a remarkable pace due to weaker European and Chinese economies, the West’s energy watchdog said on Thursday.

Weak economic growth combined with ample supply has pushed oil prices down from a high for the year above $115 hit in June, complicating efforts by central banks to ward off deflation and putting pressure on the budgets of major oil producers.

China this week reported slightly slower growth for the second quarter and the weakest expansion in factory activity in June in two years.

Asia’s diesel demand is expected to grow this year at the second lowest rate since the 1998 financial crisis as slowing economies squeeze consumption and help build a surplus for which there are few markets.

The West’s energy watchdog said on Thursday slowing global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, had curbed oil demand severely.

In the rest of the world, the global outlook is softening, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside, according to many forecasters.

Brent crude oil slipped below $66 a barrel on Wednesday, just above a five-year low, on mounting signs of oversupply and lackluster demand as global economic growth falters.

At the same time, oil demand appears to be picking up again after a long period of below-par global economic growth.

Oil fell more than $1 a barrel on Thursday to a four-year low below $83 a barrel as growing concerns over the global economy stretched a four-month rout.
