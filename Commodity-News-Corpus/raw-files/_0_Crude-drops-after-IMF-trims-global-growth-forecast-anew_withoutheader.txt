Investing.com - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for 2013, which spooked investors with fears that a slower global economy will demand less fuels and energy than once anticipated.

U.S. inventory data also pushed down prices.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude futures for delivery in June traded down 2.24% at USD87.04 a barrel on Wednesday, off from a session high of USD89.36 and up from an earlier session low of USD86.42.
The IMF earlier said it trimmed its 2013 world economic growth forecast to 3.3%, down from a January projection of 3.5%, while the multilateral lending institution's 2014 growth forecast fell to 4.0% from 4.1%.

The downward revisions came just days in wake of Chinese growth and industrial output data that fell short of market expectations as did similar numbers out of the U.S., which fanned fears that the global economy still battles headwinds.

Elsewhere in the U.S., the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 1.233 million barrels last week following a gain of 250,000 in the preceding week.

Analysts were expecting oil stockpiles to rise by 1.350 million barrels last week, and the supply data fueled the selloff by confirming fears the U.S. economy is awash in crude.

U.S. gasoline inventories, meanwhile, fell by 633,000 barrels after rising 1.699 million in the preceding week.

Analysts were expecting gasoline inventories to fall by 800,000.Elsewhere on the ICE Futures Exchange, Brent oil futures for June delivery were down 1.94% at USD97.97 a barrel, up USD10.93 from its U.S. counterpart.
